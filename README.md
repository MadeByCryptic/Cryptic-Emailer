# Cryptic_Emailer

A set of Python based email clients for quick emailing inside of the terminal. Includes (Gmail,Hotmail &amp; Yahoo)
This is one of my first projects with python, I will hopefully add all 3 into one script eventually(maybe a day or 2) but for now there are 3 different choices.

Feedback would be great!

Checklist:

Combine All 3 into 1 ~ Done

add getpass module ~ Done

Check if email sent successfully ~ Not Yet

Add Python3 functionality ~ Not Yet

##NOTE## Sometimes you will get an authentication error, just sign into your email in your browser then close the browser and try the script again.

##NOTE## For Python2 only at the moment, will be adding python3 functuality soon!
