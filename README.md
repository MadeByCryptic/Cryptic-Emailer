# <b><i>Cryptic_Emailer</i></b>

A set of Python based email clients for quick emailing inside of the terminal. Includes (Gmail,Hotmail &amp; Yahoo)
This is one of my first projects with python, I will hopefully add all 3 into one script eventually(maybe a day or 2) but for now there are 3 different choices.

Feedback would be great!

<b><i>Checklist:</i></b>

<b>.</b>Combine All 3 into 1 ~ Done

<b>.</b>add getpass module ~ Done

<b>.</b>Check if email sent successfully ~ Not Yet

<b>.</b>Add Python3 functionality ~ Done

##NOTE## Sometimes you will get an authentication error, just sign into your email in your browser then close the browser and try the script again.

##NOTE##<s> For Python2 only at the moment, will be adding python3 functuality soon!</s> It is now Python3 compatible!
